# transcribe
Small tool to help you learn your favourite language

## Compile and run
```bash
npm run compile
```

Then open `src/index.html` in your browser. For now you can only easily rewind videos with key-bindings:
- <kbd>space</kbd> - play/pause
- <kbd>m</kbd> - mark the beginning of current interval
- <kbd>r</kbd> - replay current interval

Intended usage:
- <kbd>space</kbd> - play
- wait for one sentence
- <kbd>space</kbd> - pause
- read it out loud
- <kbd>r</kbd> if you missed something. It'll replay the whole interval
- continue with <kbd>space</kbd> to start new interval
